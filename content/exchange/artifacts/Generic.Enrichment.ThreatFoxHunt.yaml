   SHOUTOUT THANKS to mike.cohen and predictiple on VQL discord getting the double foreach explained to me. Appreciate it
   
   This artifact is intended to be called to check if w/e indicators you're checking are inside ThreatFox IOCs withing the last 24 hours. 

     Ex.
       `SELECT * from Artifact.Generic.Enrichment.ThreatFoxHunt()
       
     Ex. Use in a hunt...
     '''
    LET TFData <= SELECT ioc, ioc_type FROM Artifact.Generic.Enrichment.ThreatFox()
